## Zotero Item Types and Fields

This page provides general descriptions of Zotero item types and fields. It can be helpful when entering item data into Zotero manually. The page also provides guidance on ways to store information for unusual item types.

## Item Types

Item types in Zotero should be regarded as flexible, broad categories. Item types are generally determined based on how items should be cited. See descriptions of Zotero’s item types below. If you are citing an unusual item type that does not perfectly fit one of the supported categories, choose an item type that is reasonably close with an adequate selection of fields (e.g., `Book`, `Report`, or `Manuscript` can be made to fit most unusual item types well).

You can store more specific information about the type of item (e.g., a novel versus a biography book) in the Type, Format, or Extra fields or using [tags](https://www.zotero.org/support/collections_and_tags#tags 'collections_and_tags').

| Attachment           | A standalone attachment file (e.g., a PDF, JPEG, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, or ODT file). Standalone attachment files have limited functionality in Zotero (e.g., they cannot be properly searched or cited). Always [attach files to proper Zotero items](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files#child_versus_standalone_attachment_files 'attaching_files').         |
| Note                 | A standalone note. Notes can be used for organizing and annotating in Zotero. If you cite a standalone note, Zotero will use the first 120 characters as the item title (and will treat the note as an author-less and date-less item). Citing notes is not a reliable way to add standalone commentary to a bibliography or reference list.                          |

### Fields for Books and Periodicals

| Field       | Description                                                                                |

Dictionary Title  
Encyclopedia Title | The title of the book, encyclopedia, or dictionary that a chapter, entry, or other book section is published in. |
| Volume | The volume of a (typically multi-volume) publication an article or chapter is published in. For numeric volumes, enter only a number. If the volume should be cited with a volume title, include the title in this field (e.g,. “2: Organizational Psychology”). |
| Issue | The issue number of a periodical. Typically, issues start at 1 at the beginning of each year/volume. If a periodical has only a volume number and no issue number, leave this field blank. |
| Pages | The page range of an item that is part of a larger publication. Also to be used for locators or article numbers in e-journals and ebooks. |
| Edition | The edition of a work. Where numeric, enter as simple Arabic numeral (i.e., “2” rather than “second”). |

| Series Number | The number of an item in a series. |
| Series Title | Title of a series of articles _within_ one issue of a journal (e.g., a special section or “From the Cover”). “Section Title” would likely be a more appropriate label.

### Role Labels for Media Creators

For citations to films, recordings, and broadcasts, Zotero currently has limited to support for labeling producers, scriptwriters, and some other Creator roles.

To label directors, leave the main Zotero field blank (or enter the names as Contributor) and enter the director names using `Director` in Extra. See [Citing Fields from Extra](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/item_types_and_fields#citing_fields_from_extra 'kb:item_types_and_fields ↵') below.

All Creator roles (Director, Producer, Scriptwriter, etc.) can also be labelled by entering the names using the default `author` role for the item (_Performer_ for Audio Recording, _Podcaster_ for Podcast, and _Director_ for Film, Radio Broadcast, TV Broadcast, and Video Recording) and adding the appropriate labels in parentheses after the authors' first names or last names as appropriate for your citation style—e.g., MacNaughton || Ian (Producer) for APA style. Note that the labels will be rendered verbatim in citations; enter abbreviated terms (e.g., “Prod.”) here as needed.

If the style uses initials for author first/given names, rather than full names (e.g., APA style), if the label contains multiple words (e.g., “Executive Producer” or “Writer & Director”), Zotero will abbreviate the words of the label after the first. To avoid this, type a “Word Joiner” character (Unicode U+2060, printed here between quotes: “⁠”) on either side of each space in the label.

If a Zotero item type is missing fields that are needed for citations, it is possible to add these fields to the Extra field.

Enter each variable on a separate line at the top of the Extra field in the following format:

```
CSL Variable: Value
```

For example:

```
DOI: 10.1128/AEM.02591-07
Original Date: 1824
PMCID: PMC3531190
```

With the exception of Item Type (CSL `Type`) and Date variables (CSL `Issued`, etc.), variables entered in Extra will not override corresponding values entered in proper Zotero fields.

#### Dates

Dates entered in Extra will override the date entered in Zotero's Date field. Dates must be entered in ISO format (year-month-day). Date ranges can be entered in this format:

```
Issued: 2001-12-15/2001-12-31
```

#### Names

For Creator variables, separate two-field names entered in Extra with two vertical bar characters ('||'), like this:

```
Editorial Director: De Gaulle || Charles
```

## example

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/data/citation/zotero/https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F2502.10834' \

While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue. This paper participates in open and ongoing considerations to translate social and political values and conventions, specifically social cohesion, into platform design. We propose an alternative platform model that includes the social fabric an explicit output as well as input. Citizens are members of communities defined by explicit affiliation or clusters of shared attitudes. Both have internal divisions, as citizens are members of intersecting communities, which are themselves internally diverse. Each is understood to value content that bridge (viz. achieve consensus across) and balance (viz. represent fairly) this internal diversity, consistent with the principles of the Hutchins Commission (1947). Content is labeled with social provenance, indicating for which community or citizen it is bridging or balancing. Subscription payments allow citizens and communities to increase the algorithmic weight on the content they value in the content serving algorithm. Advertisers may, with consent of citizen or community counterparties, target them in exchange for payment or increase in that party's algorithmic weight. Underserved and emerging communities and citizens are optimally subsidized/supported to develop into paying participants. Content creators and communities that curate content are rewarded for their contributions with algorithmic weight and/or revenue. We discuss applications to productivity (e.g. LinkedIn), political (e.g. X), and cultural (e.g. TikTok) platforms.",
